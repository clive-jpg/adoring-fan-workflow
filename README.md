# Adoring Fan Slack Bot

A scheduled Slack bot that posts over-the-top, Adoring Fanâ€“style morning messages. Written in the shrill, giddy voice of Oblivionâ€™s Adoring Fan, it transforms your day into theatrical spectacle.

## ðŸš€ How I Built It

1. **HTTP & Slack Workflows**  
   I started by exploring Slackâ€™s simple Workflow Builder and realized you can trigger a step based on an incoming webhook, pull a variable from the payload, and inject it into a message.

2. **AWS Lambda**  
   To make it fully serverless and reliable, I moved the logic into a Python (3.12) Lambda function that picks a random message from `messages.py` and posts it via `urllib3` to the Slack webhook.

3. **EventBridge Scheduler**  
   Slack workflows donâ€™t support scheduled posts, so I wired up an AWS EventBridge Scheduler rule (cron in UTC) to invoke the Lambda at 09:00 GMT every day. The EventBridgge itself double-checks Europe/London time so it handles BST/GMT shifts gracefully.

4. **Customization**  
   Itâ€™s easy to adapt this for other times, channels, or specific usersâ€”just update the AWS EventBridge cron expression for custom time, change the message list in the code and define the steps on who should recieve the message
